## About Me

Economist with 6 years of statistical analysis experience and expertise in geospatial, financial, household, and quantification of textual data. I am passionate about using data insights to help understand and address pressing economic issues such as climate change. An integrator with technical depth, I have the ability to communicate and collaborate across multiple disciplines, and to inform a diverse set of stakeholders in their decision-making.

## [Project 1: Climate Change and Agricultural Lending](https://github.com/tengtedliu/climate)
* Agriculture is very vulnerable to the impact of climate change. While many have focused on agricultural yields, few examine the role of financial institutions in responding to such impact. In this project, I have created a novel dataset that helps understand how climate change affects lending to U.S. farms.


## [Project 2: U.S. Banking Data](https://github.com/tengtedliu/us_banking_data)
* The banking data in the U.S. are difficult to navigate, and there are limited systemic resources outlining key steps to access such data. In this project, I describe approaches to access two main types of banking data: Y-9C, or FR Y-9C Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies, and "call report", or Report of Condition and Income.

## [Project 3: Quantification of International Treaties](https://github.com/tengtedliu/quant_treaties)
* This project employs textual analysis to categorize and quantify international treaties, and serve as an important source in illustrating the creation of international public goods to address issues such as climate change. Additionally, network analysis of such data further sheds light on the frequencies and depth of country connections.
